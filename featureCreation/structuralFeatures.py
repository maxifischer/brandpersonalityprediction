- number of lines
    --> no newlines in data
- number of blank lines
    --> no newlines in data
- has a greeting
    --> very rare usages of 'hey' or 'dear', most of them not met as a general greeting
- has a farewell
    --> very few usages at the end
- indentation
    --> was very likely removed

- paragraph length
    --> no newlines again

if we assume one post as one paragraph the following features are already covered by word-based features
- number of sentences per paragraph
- number of words per paragraph


- separators per paragraph -> separators?
- quoted content
    --> quotation marks: ", ', `, >, <, _
- use of greeting statement
